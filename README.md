# Djangoboard
Djangoboard is a somewhat deficient imageboard engine with a very creative name.

It has a lightweight responsive frontend that doesn't rely on any frameworks and uses very little JS. No crucial functionality (e.g. displaying posts' replies) needs JS to work.
Djangoboard is built with HTML5, Python programming language and Django web framework.
